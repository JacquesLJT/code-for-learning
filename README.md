# Code for Learning

This is a project that includes a webserver to display "ECE 435 Topics" webpage. The purpose of this project is to provide a learning platform to build upon topics learned in ECE 435, Network Engineering, at the University of Maine.

Currently in progress is allowing a user to upload a file to a database and encrypting that file.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory: `cd path/to/project`
3. Navigate to the webserver directory: `cd webserver`
4. Run the make command: `make`
5. Run the web server: `./updated_webserver`

## Usage

Once the web server is running, open your preferred web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. The page should display a webpage with the title "ECE 435 Topics".

This project is designed to be a learning platform, so feel free to explore the code and experiment with different features. Currently in progress is allowing a user to upload a file to a database and encrypting that file, so try experimenting with those features.

That's it! This should give users a clear understanding of how to install and use the project. You can customize it as needed to fit your project's specific needs.
