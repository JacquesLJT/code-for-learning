Answers to Question 2:
    a) 
        i) The webserver returns error code 404 meaning that the file was not found.
        ii) The webserver returns error code 418 meaning that the server is a teapot.
            Some servers will return such a code for requests they don't wish to handle.
        iii) The webserver returns error code 451 meaning that the server is unavailable for legal reasons.
    b) 
        i) The webserver that maine.edu was running on was nginx/1.16.1.
        ii) The webserver was redirection instead of giving us the requested page because the page was moved
            to the URL in the location header.
    c) Something Cool
        I did a few things for the something cool part of this assignment. I changed
        the title of the webpage to "ECE 435 Homework 2", added an underline to the
        header, and added a link to my website.
